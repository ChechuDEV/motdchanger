# Modify this to have another motd
# After changing permanent-motd use /setmotd reload (If you have set any temporary motd it will be lost)
# There are up to 10 MOTDs for the Rotation function:
# There is no need to use /setmotd reload after setting motd-rotation, only you have to set to true roation in config.yml or via ingame command /motdchange togglerotation.
# The plugin will get a random motd rotation
# Rotating MOTDs must be set next to each other, plugin won't recognize any MOTDs after an empty one
# You can put less than 10, no need to fill them all.
